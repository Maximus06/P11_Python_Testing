# Test Strategy

## What Features to test:
- Recent—New features, new areas of code, new functionality that has been
recently repaired, refactored, or otherwise modified
- Core—Your product’s unique selling propositions (USPs). The essential
functions that must continue to work in order for the product to be useful
Risk—Areas of the application that pose more risk, such as areas important
to customers but not used regularly by the development team or
parts that use third-party code you don’t quite trust
- Problematic—Functionality that frequently breaks or often gets defect
reports against it
- Expertise—Features or algorithms understood by a limited subset of people

## Test cases
### Then for each feature, we are going to list test cases using these criteria:

- Start with a non-trivial, happy path test case.
- Then look at test cases that represent:
    - interesting sets of input,
    - interesting starting states,
    - interesting end states, or
    - all possible error states.
